References to “you” or “your” will also be deemed references to that individual, company or legal entity.

#### 1\. License Grants

During the Term, you grant to Slack a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, and royalty-free license to (a) reproduce, perform, display, and use your Application for administrative and demonstration purposes in connection with the operation, improvement and marketing of the Slack App Directory; (b) distribute your Application through the Slack App Directory; (c) perform a Security Review on your Application; and (d) use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, and domain names associated with your Application (collectively, **“Your Names”**) as a reference for marketing or promotional purposes on and in connection with the Slack App Directory and in other communications with, or promotions for, existing or potential developers, partners and customers about the Slack App Directory. For example, we might include Your Names on the Slack App Directory and in blog posts about the Slack App Directory. Slack will comply with your written trademark usage policies as communicated by you to Slack from time to time.

#### 4\. Security Review

During the Term, you grant permission to Slack and its designated personnel, to perform, at times and dates selected by Slack, one or more security reviews on your Application, and related services and/or computer systems, as more fully described at [Slack App Security Review](https://api.slack.com/security-review) (each, a **“Security Review”**).

All such information and results are confidential and will be treated as such; provided, that Slack may disclose such information and results to a third party as required by law or to the extent such information and results is in an aggregate form that does not identify your or the Application, and that is stripped of all persistent identifiers (e.g., device identifiers, IP addresses, and cookie IDs). At any time during a Security Review, you may request Slack to promptly stop the tests, however, such request may result in a ‘Failed’ review. You have sole responsibility for adequate protection and backup of data and/or equipment used in connection with a Security Review and will not make a claim against Slack for lost data, re-run time, inaccurate output, work delays or lost profits resulting from a Security Review.

#### 7\. Review Ratings
