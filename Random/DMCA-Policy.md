# DMCA Policy

**Effective: November 17, 2016**

We take the intellectual property rights of others seriously and require that our Customers and their Authorized Users do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act established a process for addressing claims of copyright infringement that we have implemented for Slack services. If you own a copyright or have authority to act on behalf of a copyright owner and want to report a claim that a third party is infringing that material on or through a Slack service, please send a notice to our copyright agent that includes all of the items below and we will expeditiously take appropriate action:

1.  A description of the copyrighted work that you claim is being infringed;
1.  A description of the material you claim is infringing and that you want removed or access to which you want disabled and the URL or other location of that material;
1.  Your address, telephone number, and email address;
1.  The following statement: “I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material I am complaining of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (e.g., as a fair use)”;
1.  The following statement: “The information in this notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, I am the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of the copyright or of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed”; and
1.  An electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or a person authorized to act on the owner's behalf.

Our designated copyright agent to receive such claims can be reached as follows:

**By mail:**

This process does not limit our ability to pursue any other remedies we may have to address suspected infringement.
