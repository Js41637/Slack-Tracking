# Transparency Report

At Slack we are committed to trust and transparency. As part of this commitment, we publish periodic reports about requests for data by law enforcement and governmental entities. The latest report is below and covers all such requests received from April 29, 2016 through April 30, 2017\. More information about our policies and practices with respect to data (including definitions of terms not defined herein) can be found in the [Slack Terms of Service](https://slack.com/terms-of-service), [Privacy Policy](https://slack.com/privacy-policy), [Security Practices](https://slack.com/security-practices) and [Data Request Policy](https://slack.com/user-data-request-policy).

In addition to our belief in the importance of trust and transparency, as outlined here and in our policies, we believe in the importance of fundamental privacy protections, constitutional guardrails, and judicial oversight of government data collection and surveillance. We support codifying reforms to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act expiring this year in order to reduce the overly broad collection of information.

## Guiding Principles

*   We are committed to maintaining Customer privacy and confidentiality
*   Every request is carefully reviewed for valid legal process
*   All requests will be construed narrowly by Slack
*   Wherever possible we encourage Customers and third parties to seek data without our intervention

## Requests for information through legal process

During this period we received a total of eight requests for information from US law enforcement and governmental entities. Of those requests, five were found valid and resulted in the disclosure of Non-content data, two are pending, and one was invalid. We have not received any requests for information from, nor have we provided any information to, non-US law enforcement authorities.
