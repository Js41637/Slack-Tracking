//MigrationManager is not migrated into TypeScript at this moment for reason
//- TS does not support rest/spread property yet (planned in 2.1), better to wait instead move to Object.assign and back again
//(https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/2103)
export const MigrationManager: any;
export default MigrationManager; //tslint:disable-line
